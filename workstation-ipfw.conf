## Consider outbound traffic is allowed only in the 49152–65535 port range.
## To check the default ephemeral port range in your system issue these commands:
## sudo sysctl net.inet.ip.portrange.first
## sudo sysctl net.inet.ip.portrange.last
## To modify the default ephemeral port range issue the following command:
## sudo sysctl net.inet.ip.portrange.first=49152
## sudo sysctl net.inet.ip.portrange.last=65535
## To make this permanent modify the /etc/sysctl.conf file in your system and add:
## net.inet.ip.portrange.first=49152
## net.inet.ip.portrange.last=65535
